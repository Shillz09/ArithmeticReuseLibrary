# ArithmeticReuseLibrary
Library designed to be reused for arithmetic functions in BASH.  
I've always found that I need to do basic arithmetic functions in my scripts, but I always have to go lookup how to do them properly. Well not anymore!

Please make sure you properly update your PATH with the location of these scripts, or use the full path. I recommend setting some aliases in the arithmeticEnv.sh file. But I won't tell you how to live your life. You do you. 

1. For anyone who wants to push changes, the script name needs say exactly what the script does, i.e. addition.sh should do addition and only addition.

2. Each script should accept "-h", "-?", and "--help" for a help menu and explanation of parameters

3. Pull requests will need to include updates to 'arithmeticEnv.sh' with additional functions as needed.

4. File names are in camelCase. Function names are in snake_case.
