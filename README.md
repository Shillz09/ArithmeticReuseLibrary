# ArithmeticReuseLibrary
Library designed to be reused for arithmetic functions in BASH.  
I've always found that I need to do basic arithmetic functions in my scripts, but I always have to go lookup how to do them properly, especially when my inputs are a mixture of integers and strings. 

Please make sure you properly update your PATH with the location of these scripts, or use the full path. I won't tell you how to live your life. You do you. 

1. For anyone who wants to push changes, the script name needs say exactly what the script does. (Addition.sh should do addition and only addition.)
2. Each script should accept "-h", "-?", and "--help" for an explanation of how to input parameters.
